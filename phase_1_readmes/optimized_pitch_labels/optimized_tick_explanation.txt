Refined Hertz Tick Label System â€“ Octave Number Lab
---------------------------------------------------
This system produces a tick and label grid optimized for a readable and musically aligned display.

Label Criteria:
- Whole numbers divisible by 5 are prioritized.
- Decimals allowed only if they end in .25, .5, or .75 (e.g., 12.5, 22.25).
- Tick marks may exist without labels to visually interpolate.
- Above 1600 Hz, only values divisible by 10 are labeled to reduce clutter.
- All tick positions are derived using logarithmic (log2) spacing, with a minimum distance between ticks.

Range: 13.75 Hz to 7040 Hz
Log2 Spacing Threshold: 0.05
