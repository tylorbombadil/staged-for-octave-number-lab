                                  Octave Number Lab:
    This readme will tell you all you need to know about my amazing invention that will blow you away!
 
    It is essentially a sandbox for exotic musical scales that are based on a prime density algorithm that I have been working on for 20 years. So, sit back and
 enjoy the summery of this amazing work!

    Since the age of 14 years old, I have been intently listenning to overtones. I have always looked for the next cool thing to think about or do that usually 
involved physics, music, art, or invented games - my favorite topics. 
    What fascinated me about about the overtone seiries is that after I first started paying attention to it, I noticed that it can be heard everywhere, the human 
voice, hair cutters, airplane engines, every musical instrument, and so many more. 
     In case you are ciurious, I will give a breif explanation of what an overtone is. I can hear up to 20 separate tones when I am listenning to a single musical note.
Aside from having exceptionally good ears to hear these tones, I have also done a fair bit of study on the simple math and science behind them.
    The overtone seireis is a pattern of notes that is mostly always the same, that can be heared resonating from a single vibrating string. This is because a string
does not vibrate merely back and fourth along it whole length, it also vibrates in halves, thirds, fourths, fifths and so on, in consecutive devisions. These 
divisions also multiply the fundamental vibration of the string by the recipracole of the division creating a seiries of ascending tones from the initial main
frequency of the sounding string. If you play a low piano note and focus on what you can hear beyond the apparent fundamental pitch(which is the number 1 
in music form), you might be able to hear the number 2, which is and octave higher than the fundamenal tone, the number 3, which is and octave + a perfect 
fifth above the fundamentl tone, the numer 4, which is two octaves above the fundamental tone, or perhaps the number 5, wich is two octves and a major third above 
the fundamental tone. This is enough to dirive the major cord by purely basing them on the first few overtones! 
    I showed you the first five tones 1234 and 5, but I can hear 123456789 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 and beyond! I did not discover their increadably simple
mathematical sequense, but I eagerly varified that these tones in every way imaginable reflect in harmonious intervals the same simple traits of whole number
relationships. Every prime number tone, as would seem intuitive, does not relate to any of the other tones. Insidentally, the major cord is dirived from three prime
numbers 1, 5, and 3! I might add here that the prime number 2 is the only prime that sounds the same as another tone. Its relationship with the number 1(wich 
is the fundamental tone) is a perfect octave! They sound like the same note, which is why in music the octave recieves the same note letter!
    This kind of set of relationships is what makes the beautiful musical tones a percievable reality!
