# 🎨 Octave Number Lab – UI Appearance & Functionality Summary

This document preserves the core **visual philosophy and user interface principles** of the Octave Number Lab. In case of catastrophe or creative pause, this serves as the ember from which the vision can be rekindled.

## 🖤 Background & Framing

- The entire interface rests on a **pure black background**, creating a focused, immersive environment.
- **Soft gray** and **white lines** are used sparingly to create subtle frames and spatial boundaries.
- **Color is sacred and categorical**—each hue is purposefully linked to a semantic role. These roles are consistent and intuitive, inviting the user to build familiarity through repetition.

---

## 🌊 Blue – The Tree and Its Bones

- **Blue is the lifeblood of structure.**
- Used to wireframe the **scale tree in the side panel**, and to outline **original scale stems**.
- When a **note is selected to become a parent/root**, it is highlighted in **blue**.
- **Blue represents inherited structure, relationships, and visual lineage**.
- Notes that are **not root-bound** are rendered in a **soft light cream**, providing visual separation without harsh contrast.

**→ Blue means tree. Blue means ancestry.**

---

## 🌿 Green – Selection and Editorial Presence

- **Green is always selection.**
- Any scale that is touched or worked on receives a glowing **neon green outline**.
- This outline reflects **editorial focus**—where attention and interaction are currently being applied.
- Green confirms to the user: *“This is what you're working on right now.”*

**→ Green means touch. Green means focus.**

## 🔴 Red – Crafting, Seeds, and Generation

- **Red is for independence and rebirth.**
- When building a new scale group, users work in the **crafting panel**, which is fixed to the **bottom of the workspace**.
- Newly crafted groups begin as **blue skeletons**—transparent wireframes lacking identity.
- Unlike untouched tree stems:
  - They don’t show the prime field.
  - They don’t have a blue outline.
  - They appear skeletal and neutral.
- Once **severed from their parent**, these crafted groups **turn red**:
  - Their outline, spine, and stems are all **red**.
  - They are now **seeds**, capable of becoming new tree structures.
- On the **generator side**, red also represents **generation-in-progress**.
- This ties into a metaphor: **red fruit from a blue tree**—a system capable of planting itself anew.

**→ Red means seed. Red means crafting. Red means creation.**

## 💛 Yellow – Playback Stream and Motion

- **Yellow is signal and sound.**
- Each scale has a **light gray hollow circle** for stream activation.
- Clicking this circle **activates the yellow light**, showing which scale is currently being played or streamed.
- Only **one yellow light** can exist in the tree at a time—it travels based on the user's focus.
- The **audio bar** at the bottom always displays a **soft yellow glow**, showing readiness to play any selected target.

**→ Yellow means sound. Yellow means stream. Yellow means play.**

This system of color and structure is the visual logic of the Octave Number Lab. It is not only intuitive—it is poetic. Designed for clarity, beauty, and expressive exploration.
