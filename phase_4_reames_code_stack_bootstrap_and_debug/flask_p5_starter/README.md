# Flask + p5.js Starter Template

This is a lightweight template for rapid iteration using:

- Flask (Python backend, API, templating)
- p5.js (JS frontend for creative visual output)

### Structure
- `app.py` — Flask app entry
- `templates/index.html` — Webpage entry with p5.js script
- `static/sketch.js` — Canvas logic using p5.js

### Running
```bash
python3 app.py
```

This setup is ideal for:
- Fast UI and interaction experiments
- AI-assisted Python/JS prototyping
- Running smoothly on low-RAM machines (e.g. Chromebook)

You can later refactor this into Tauri if needed.
