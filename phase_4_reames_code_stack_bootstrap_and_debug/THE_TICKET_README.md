# The Ticket: Local Flask + File Access Strategy

## Summary

This ZIP outlines the method we’ve chosen for enabling full file system access and local export capabilities using Flask, avoiding the heavier setup of Tauri or Electron. It leverages Flask in localhost mode and optionally integrates with PyWebView for a native feel. This method is ideal for fast iteration on low-resource devices like a 4GB Chromebook.

---

## Why This Works

- Flask runs locally, giving backend access to the filesystem.
- Python can read/write `.mp3`, `.midi`, `.json`, etc. using standard libraries.
- UI can trigger downloads via `send_file()` or render direct download links.
- PyWebView can give the app a native wrapper if needed without browser constraints.
- Very lightweight, AI-friendly, and avoids complex glue code.

## Example: Download Endpoint

```python
from flask import Flask, send_file

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/download")
def download():
    return send_file("output/song_export.mid", as_attachment=True)
```

---

## Example: Use with PyWebView

```bash
pip install pywebview
```

```python
import webview
webview.create_window("My App", "http://127.0.0.1:5000")
webview.start()
```

---

## Recommended File Output Strategy

Just use a known folder like `output/` for all temporary exports:

```python
with open("output/rendered_scale.mid", "wb") as f:
    f.write(midi_data)
```

Then open the file manually to test it.

## Comparison with Tauri

| Feature                        | Flask Localhost Mode      | Tauri                         |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Access to file system         | ✅ Full (Python backend)   | ✅ Native but more setup       |
| Easy iteration                | ✅ Very easy                | ⚠️ Requires rebuilds           |
| Good AI support               | ✅ Excellent                | ⚠️ Rust glue = harder for AI   |
| Setup on 4GB Chromebook       | ✅ Smooth and lightweight   | ⚠️ Heavy, may slow iteration   |
| MP3/MIDI export and testing   | ✅ Trivial                  | ✅ Also doable                 |

## Final Verdict

Use Flask + PyWebView (optional) as the glue layer. Fast, stable, and smart for your resource-constrained setup.

This is the ticket.
