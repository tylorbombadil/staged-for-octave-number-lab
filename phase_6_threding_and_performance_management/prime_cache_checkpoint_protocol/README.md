# 🧭 Smart Prime Cache Protocol: Checkpointed Intelligence

## Guiding Principle
*"Whatever is loaded today, is usable today."*  
We do not wait on future promises — the app adapts to what's currently cached, and continues growing behind the scenes.

## ✅ Core Features

### 📦 Checkpoint-Based Caching
- Prime tiers are broken into *modular checkpoints* (e.g. every 2 tiers).
- Each checkpoint is usable on its own — full scale/zoom/navigation enabled within it.
- If a later checkpoint isn't loaded, the UI naturally *fades or limits scroll* beyond it.

### 🪄 Transparent Use
- User never needs to "manage" what’s cached.
- The app shows what's available and offers helpful prompts when limits are reached (e.g. “Tier 24–26 still generating”).

### 🌙 Deferred Completion
- Background threader continues loading deeper checkpoints based on user-defined limits (e.g. "while idle overnight", "1 hour/day").
- If the device reboots, the task resumes from last checkpoint.

### 🔋 Graceful Degradation
- If device runs low on RAM or user interrupts, threader safely halts.
- Existing data remains valid and usable — never lost or corrupted.

## 🧠 UX Impact

- Feels like *exploring a vast forest* — what's nearby is clear and detailed; what's distant appears misty until discovered.
- Ensures *performance remains fluid*, even on 4GB devices.
- Encourages long-term growth — like a bonsai tree, this app grows naturally with time.
