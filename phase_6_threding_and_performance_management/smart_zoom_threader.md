# Smart Zoom Threader Protocol

This document outlines a three-tiered system for managing memory and performance while exploring deeply zoomable harmonic number lines using prime-based data.

## ‚úÖ Three-Tier Prime Exploration Strategy

### Tier 1: Real-Time UI Range
- **Depth**: Up to ~Tier 22 (may vary with zoom density).
- **Memory Use**: Light (~hundreds of MBs).
- **Performance**: Smooth, fluid interaction.
- **Use Case**: Regular UI zooms, real-time playback and manipulation.
- **Behavior**: Instant navigation, all prime points remain in RAM.

---

### Tier 2: Background-Rendered Cache Zone
- **Depth**: ~Tier 23‚Äì26 (adjustable by user‚Äôs time budget).
- **Memory Use**: Moderate (~hundreds of MBs to ~2.5GB max).
- **Performance**: Not real-time, but preloaded over time.
- **Use Case**: Semi-deep zooms that the user can explore later.
- **Behavior**: Smart threader generates this region in the background. Example: ‚ÄúGenerate Zone 25‚Äì26 within 24 hrs‚Äù.

### Tier 3: Ultra-Deep Agent-Based Threaded Dive
- **Depth**: Tier 27 and beyond (limitless, constrained only by available storage and patience).
- **Memory Use**: Capped. Uses temporary cache only.
- **Performance**: Asynchronous and deferred; data never resides fully in RAM.
- **Use Case**: Mandelbrot-style planned dives for scale generation or immersive playback.
- **Behavior**:
  - System alerts the user when entering deep territory.
  - Offers a time-based rendering estimate and configuration panel.
  - Generates temporary scale data and deletes cache after unless pinned.
  - Supports resumable dives and multi-device state sync (future scope).

---

## üîí Safe Overflow Policy
- Cap memory usage at **~3.5GB** to reserve space for system functions.
- Continuously monitor memory and active cache size.
- Trigger scale-back operations or prompt warnings as the limit approaches.

This modular threader system empowers all users‚Äîfrom lightweight devices to pro rigs‚Äîto harness the infinite structure of primes without performance breakdown, using a memory-conscious zoom model.
