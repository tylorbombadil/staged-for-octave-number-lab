# ðŸŽ¼ Octave Number Lab

Octave Number Lab is a modular environment for designing, exploring, and analyzing harmonic pitch scales using number theory and musical geometry. This README serves as the primary entry point for developers, collaborators, and AI tools.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

The project builds a highly visual, interactive system that models musical scales via prime number reduction, logarithmic pitch mapping, and hierarchical interval inheritance. Designed to support deep exploration and intuitive interaction, it aims to scale from desktop to APK and remain extensible through modular plugins.

## ðŸ—‚ Structure Overview

Each folder contains a scoped README and dedicated logic or design focus. All links are relative, ensuring GitHub-native and offline navigation.

- ðŸ”¢ [Algorithms](algorithms/README.md) â€” Core logic for generating and transforming scales.
- ðŸŽ¨ [UI](ui/README.md) â€” All frontend layout, interaction models, and design theory.
- ðŸ“¤ [Export](export/README.md) â€” Data output formats, audio rendering, and file naming strategy.
- ðŸ§  [Memory](memory/README.md) â€” Project concept memory, developer intents, and persistent logic structures.

> âœ… This structure is built for semantic navigation by both humans and AI. Expand each folder with topic-specific docs as needed.

## ðŸ§­ Navigation Tips

- Use the folder READMEs to drill down into each section
- All documentation is modular and AI-scalable
- Internal headers can be linked using GitHub markdown anchors

Happy exploring.
